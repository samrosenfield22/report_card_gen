Welcome to the report card generator!
Its purpose is to automate the report card preparation process by fixing font mismatches,
creating a list of missing reports, and automatically converting google docs to PDFs.

To use, do the following:
1. Get the "Google Drive IDs" -- every Drive folder has an ID that this program needs to run.
Open the Drive folder in your browser, and copy the string of characters after '/u/0/folders/'.
2. Go to File > Set google drive folder IDs.
3. Paste those Drive IDs into this file (each on its own line), then save and close the file.
4. Set the options you want, and click the button!
